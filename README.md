# -Exploring-User-Goals-Concerns-and-Symptoms-.-An-Analysis
### In this data analysis project, we delve into a dataset collected from , a health and wellness platform, to gain insights into users' goals, concerns, and symptoms
Our aim is to extract meaningful patterns from the data that shed light on the most prominent health-related aspirations of the users.

We start by loading the dataset and performing initial data preprocessing steps. The dataset contains various columns, including user identifiers, answer creation timestamps, keys, values, and extracted words. Our analysis focuses on the "key" column, which includes questions about users' primary goals, concerns, and symptoms.

We specifically concentrate on three key aspects: user goals, concerns, and symptoms. For user goals and concerns, we identify and extract keywords related to "health" and categorize them into distinct groups. Using regular expressions, we filter relevant responses and create a consolidated view of the most significant goals and concerns expressed by the users. These insights are visualized using pie charts and bar graphs, showcasing the distribution and frequency of different health-related goals and concerns.

Furthermore, we explore user-reported symptoms. By identifying keywords associated with various symptoms, we categorize and analyze the prevalence of symptoms reported by users. Similar to the goals and concerns analysis, we present the results through informative graphs that provide an overview of the most commonly reported symptoms.

Overall, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the preferences, needs, and health-related challenges faced by users of Lifeforce. By uncovering trends and patterns within the dataset, we contribute to a deeper understanding of users' perspectives and provide a foundation for data-driven decision-making on the platform.
